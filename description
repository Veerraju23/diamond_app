Project Title: Diamond Price Analysis & Prediction Web App
  
Project Description:
This project is a data-driven web application that analyzes the key characteristics of diamonds and predicts their price using machine learning techniques. Built using Python, Pandas, Streamlit, and Scikit-learn, the app allows users to explore diamond data visually and estimate the price of a diamond based on its attributes.

Objectives:
To provide visual insights into how diamond features (carat, cut, clarity, etc.) affect pricing.
To predict the price of a diamond using Linear Regression based on selected input parameters.
To deliver a simple, interactive, and browser-based tool for diamond pricing analysis.

Dataset Used:
The dataset includes features such as:
carat: Weight of the diamond
cut: Quality of the cut (e.g., Ideal, Premium)
colour: Color grading of the diamond
clarity: Diamond clarity grade
depth: Total depth percentage
table: Width of top facet relative to the widest point
size: Custom field for physical size
price: Price in USD (target variable)

Tech Stack:
Component	Technology
Frontend	Streamlit (Python UI)
Backend	Python
Data Handling	Pandas
Visualization	Seaborn, Matplotlib
Machine Learning	Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
App Execution	CMD / Terminal

Key Features:
Interactive data exploration with charts and heatmaps
Real-time diamond price prediction based on user input
Price distribution and correlation insights
Automatic label encoding for categorical data
Browser-based interface (no need to install a frontend framework)

How It Works:
Load the dataset (diamond.csv) and clean column names.
Visualize key relationships and distributions (e.g., price vs. cut).
Train a simple Linear Regression model on the data.
Take user inputs (carat, cut, clarity, etc.) via Streamlit sidebar.
Encode the input, make predictions, and show the estimated price.

How to Run the App:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/project
streamlit run diamond_app.py
Then open: http://localhost:8501

Future Improvements (Optional Ideas):
Add more ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
Allow uploading custom CSV files
Add filtering, sorting, or clustering
Deploy the app using Streamlit Cloud or Render
